Day 2
Intro
U: I have too much work
P: Ok, can you give me more details on why that is stressing?
U: I don’t have enough private time
P: Hmm I see..
Let me ask you something, what is the worst possible outcome of work?
U: What do you mean?
P: Ok, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being almost impossible, how likely is this scenario?
U: 6
P: In that case, what could you do to get back on track if it does happen
U: i don’t know
P: Could you try and think of a solution?
U: yes
P: See you have a plan B. Just remember that if you’re stressing that there is always a way to get back on your feet. Thank you for sharing with me. I hope I have been able to help. Have a nice day!

Day 3
Intro
U: I am preparing a demo and presentation for next week
P: Ok, can you give me more detail about this demo?
U: I am nervous because it will for executives
P: I see how that can be stressful.
I want you to take a couple minutes and write at least one positive aspect about your situation.
Let me know when you are done.
U: It is good because I can showcase my work
P: Is there another positive you can find in your situation?
U: Will meet a lot of people 
P: See, you can usually find positives even when in the most negative of situations.
Positive thinking can be a good way to destress, making it easier to face challenges.
Thank you for sharing with me. I hope I have been able to help. Have a nice day!
U: you too
