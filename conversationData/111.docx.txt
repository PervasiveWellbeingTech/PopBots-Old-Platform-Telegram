Day 1


B: Hello [name], I’m Popbot
I’m here to help you with your stress.
Can you tell me a little bit about a recent school/work related event that is stressing you out?
U: I sprained my ankle
B: Can you give me more details on why that is stressing?
U: It’s painful and it disrupts my daily tasks
B: Hmm I see…
Let me ask you something, what is the worst possible outcome 
U: It never healing or taking a really long time to. Injuring my other foot too would suck
B: Ok, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being almost impossible, how likely is this scenario?
U: 4
B: So would you agree the worst case situation is unlikely?
U: I guess so
B: Seems like you have things in perspective.
Try not to spend too much time worrying about scenarios that probably won’t happen.
Thank you for sharing with me. I hope I have been able to help. Have a nice day!

Day 3
Introduction
U: I’m leaving next week and I have to figure out my flights and pack
B: Can you give me more details on why that is stressing?
U: I hate buying plane tickets and I’m worried that getting to the airport will be difficult with my sprained ankle
B: Hmm I see…
Let me ask you something, what is the worst possible outcome
U: I buy a ticket and I miss my flight because of my foot
B: Ok, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being almost impossible, how likely is this scenario?
U: 5
B: In that case, what could you do to get back on track if it does happen?
U: I would probably have to go to the airport and take the next flight out
B: See you have a plan B. Just remember if you’re stressing that there is always a way to get back on your feet.
